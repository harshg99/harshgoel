We propose a new MARL method for
traffic signal control, SocialLight, which learns cooperative traffic
control policies by distributedly estimating the individual marginal
contribution of agents on their local neighborhood. Our results show that SocialLight
exhibits improved scalability to larger road networks and better
performance across usual traffic metrics.
